# Tinier AES

Very Simple and Easy To Use AES Functions based off of [Tiny-AES-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c "Tiny-AES-c"), all slimmed down into one file with a configurable Nb, Nk, and Nr value, with some included bit and byte utilities, several wrapper functions for OFB and CTR mode, and a very easy to follow demo to help you write your own code for it.

Just copy and paste the aes.c file into any folder you want and be sure to `#include "aes.c"` in your .c file.
